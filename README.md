# haploCOBB
Workflow for generating haplotypes from DNA Metabarcoding data and generation of population genetic datasets. 

# haploCOBB_pipeline.txt 
Workflow that implements OBITools for initial read processing and quality control. JAMP (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP) is used to generate haplotype level data. Data is reformatted to mimic traditional population genetic datasets for demographic analysis.

# ngsfilter
Information containing sample names, barcodes and primers for demultiplexing with OBITools.
